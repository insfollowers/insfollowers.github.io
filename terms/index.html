<h3>The Terms of Service for Followers Tracker Report</h3>
<p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you — you should make sure that you read them
carefully before using the app. You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in
any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you are also not allowed to try to
translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
    database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to this App.</p>

<h3>Main Terms</h3>
<p>The Followers Tracker Report app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide
our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We, therefore, recommend that you
do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by
the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
which compromise your phone’s security features, and it is possible that the The-Followers Tracker Report app won’t work
properly or at all.</p>

<p>You are solely responsible for any activity that occurs through your account. You agree and undertake that you will use
Followers Tracker Report for Instagram accounts that are legally owned by you and you will not interfere with
third-party accounts. Followers Tracker Report prohibits the creation of an account for anyone other than yourself. You
also represent that all information you provide or provided to Followers Tracker Report upon registration and at all
other times will be true.</p>

<p>You agree that you will not solicit, collect or use the login credentials of other Followers Tracker Report & Instagram
users. You are responsible for keeping your password secret and secure. You may not use the Service for any illegal or
unauthorized purpose. You agree to comply with all laws, rules, and regulations. You are solely responsible for your
conduct and content</p>

<p>You must not access Followers Tracker Report private API by means other than those permitted. You must not interfere or
disrupt the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service, including by transmitting any worms, viruses,
spyware, malware, or any other code of a destructive or disruptive nature.</p>

<p>You must not create accounts with the Service through unauthorized means, including but not limited to, by using an
automated device, script, bot, spider, crawler, or scraper. Violation of these Terms of service may, in Followers
Tracker Report’s sole discretion, result in termination of your account. You understand and agree that Followers Tracker
Report cannot and will not be responsible for the actions you use the Service at your own risk. If you violate the
letter or spirit of these Terms of Service or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for Followers Tracker
Report, we can stop providing all or part of the Service to you.</p>

<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that This App will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of
the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your
mobile network provider, but This App cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you
don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

<p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re
accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
using the app.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, This App cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure
that your device stays charged — if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail of the Service, This App
cannot accept responsibility</p>

<p>With respect to This App’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in
mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to
provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. This App accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

We may update our Terms of Service from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any
changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms of Service on this page. These changes are effective
immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
