<p>You need to ensure that your authorized third-party payment method has sufficient balance to support the debit amount. If the automatic debit fails due to insufficient balance, your continuous subscription period will automatically terminate after the paid service period (billing cycle) expires, and you will no longer be able to continue to use the original rights.</p>
<p>If you choose to subscribe to the Intelligent Robot member, payment will be deducted from your Apple ID account, and you will be charged for renewal within 24 hours before the current cycle ends. You can go to Settings in the App Store at any time after purchase to turn off automatic renewal.</p>
<p>Open the App Store---click the avatar icon in the upper right corner to enter the account page---click Manage Subscriptions---Cancel Subscription</p>
<p>You can also cancel the subscription through this link: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039</a></p>
<p>The above cancellation methods may change from time to time due to software upgrades of third-party payment institutions. If you are unable to operate the continuous subscription service due to the aforementioned reasons, please contact customer service according to the contact information specified in this rule as soon as possible.</p>
